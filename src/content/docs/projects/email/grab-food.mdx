Tired of manually tracking your GrabFood expenses? This script automates the entire process by connecting to your Gmail, parsing e-receipts, and logging every detail directly into a Google Sheet.

Designed for Google Colab, it leverages native secret management to keep your credentials safe and encrypted.

**Ready to get started?** Grab the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lTRCmxX-94QnVGaAhzYkOkuEEqTLEnMh) and follow the setup guide below.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Monthly Batching**: Fetches data in monthly chunks to avoid connection timeouts with Gmail's IMAP server.
- **Deep Parsing**: Uses **BeautifulSoup4** to navigate complex HTML email structures, ensuring accurate data extraction.
- **Deduplication**: Fingerprints each receipt (Date + Restaurant) to prevent duplicate entries if the script is re-run.
- **Financial Breakdown**: Separates the subtotal, delivery fee, order fee, packaging, and promos for easy budgeting.

## 🛠️ Setup & Requirements

### 1. Google Account Security (App Password)

To connect to Gmail via IMAP, you'll need an **App Password**. Standard passwords won't work if you have 2-Step Verification enabled.

1.  Go to your [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2.  Search for **"App Passwords"**.
3.  Create a new app named `GrabFood Tracker`.
4.  **Copy the 16-character code**. You'll need it in a later step.

### 2. Google Sheets Configuration

1.  Create a new Google Sheet.
2.  Get your **Spreadsheet ID** from the URL:
    `docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**`[YOUR_ID_HERE]`**`/edit`
3.  The script will automatically create the header row if the sheet is empty.

### 3. Colab Secrets Management

To keep your credentials secure, use Colab's secret management:

1.  Open the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lTRCmxX-94QnVGaAhzYkOkuEEqTLEnMh).
2.  Click the **Key icon** (Secrets) on the left sidebar.
3.  Add the following secrets:
    - `EMAIL_USER`: Your full Gmail address.
    - `APP_PASSWORD`: The 16-character code from Step 1.
4.  Ensure the **"Notebook access"** toggle is turned **ON** for both.
